						Hello Coder Dojo fans! Thanks for joining us today, for our 4rd Edition of the Coder Dojo.
						As you might remember, the first two editions were about TDD and Pair Programming and the
						third one, last month about Designing RESTful APIs.

						This is a followup Coder Dojo to the last one, as at the last one we had 85 registrants.

						So you're the lucky ones able to participate today.
						And as this is one of the first Coder Dojos in a longer series, your feedback is really important.
						We'll have a feedback session, as usual.

						So again, welcome!

						### What is a Dojo?
						A **DOJO** is a formal training place for the Japanese do **arts**
						![What is a Dojo](images/kendo-dojo.jpg)

						Notes:
						Inside of the dojo there are strict rules:
						Don’t wear a hat or shoes
						Don’t eat
						Treat each other with respect
						And we'll have some rules of our own
					</script>

					<h2>What are Katas?</h2>
					<p>Kata (型 or 形 literally: "form") is a Japanese word describing detailed choreographed patterns of movements practised either solo or in pairs.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						In martial arts, a kata is a precise set of choreographed movements that simulates one side of a combat. The goal, which is asymptotically approached, is perfection.
						The artist strives to teach his body to make each movement perfectly and to assemble those movements into a fluid act.
						Well-executed kata are beautiful to watch.
						But, although they are beautiful, the purpose of learning a kata is not to perform it on stage. The purpose is to train your mind and body how to react in a particular combat situation. The goal is to make the perfected movements automatic and instinctive so that they are there when you need them.

						What’s the link between programming and martial arts?
						Why am I talking about Dojo and Katas and not about computers here?

						### Programming Is An Art

						* We create something out of nothing
						* There are many ways to do one thing
						* Sometimes the solution comes from the gut
						* You have to be able to react quickly
						* Art creates reactions

					<h2>Artists and Practice</h2>
					<p>Artists use more than 95% of their time to practice</p>

						### What About Us?

						* Programmers are asked to perform most of their time
						* We have to write production code, which is performing
						* We have stress of deadlines
						* We have pressure from different sides
						* We don’t have time to practice
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
					<script type="text/template">
						### What do we need in order to improve?

						* We need a safe place to practice
						* Pressure off
						* We have to learn how to play with code/design
						* It has to be fun
					</script>

						### Coder Dojo Rulez

						* Timeboxed
						* After each session, delete your code
						* Short retrospective after each session
						* It has to be fun

						Notes:
						Timeboxed - we'll help us try more things, and we'll have more sessions.

						Delete our code - this will release the pressure, the goal is not to deliver something, but concentrate on the process

						We have to learn, so we need to reflect on what we just did

						If it's not fun, we're doing it wrong!
