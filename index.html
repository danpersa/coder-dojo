					  <p>Hello Coder Dojo fans! Thanks for joining us today, for our 9th Edition of the Coder Dojo.</p>
						<p>The subject for this one is TDD and Pair Programming.</p>
						<p>As we always strive to improve our dojos, your feedback is really important.</p>
						<p>We'll have a feedback session, as usual.</p>
						<p>So again, welcome!</p>

						### What is a Dojo?
						A **DOJO** is a formal training place for the Japanese do **arts**
						![What is a Dojo](images/kendo-dojo.jpg)

						Notes:
						Inside of the dojo there are strict rules:

						* Don’t wear a hat or shoes
						* Don’t eat
						* Treat each other with respect

						And we'll have some rules of our own
					</script>
				</section>

				<section class="image-section  more-opaque"

					<h2>What are Katas?</h2>
					<p>Kata (型 or 形 literally: "form") is a Japanese word describing detailed choreographed patterns of movements practised either solo or in pairs.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						In martial arts, a kata is a precise set of choreographed movements that simulates one side of a combat. The goal, which is asymptotically approached, is perfection.
						The artist strives to teach his body to make each movement perfectly and to assemble those movements into a fluid act.
						Well-executed kata are beautiful to watch.
						But, although they are beautiful, the purpose of learning a kata is not to perform it on stage. The purpose is to train your mind and body how to react in a particular combat situation. The goal is to make the perfected movements automatic and instinctive so that they are there when you need them.

						What’s the link between programming and martial arts?
						Why am I talking about Dojo and Katas and not about computers here?

						### Programming Is An Art

						* We create something out of nothing
						* There are many ways to do one thing
						* Sometimes the solution comes from the gut
						* You have to be able to react quickly
						* Art creates reactions

					<h2>Artists and Practice</h2>
					<p>Artists use more than 95% of their time to practice</p>

						### What About Us?

						* Programmers are asked to perform most of their time
						* We have to write production code, which is performing
						* We have stress of deadlines
						* We have pressure from different sides
						* We don’t have time to practice
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
					<script type="text/template">
						### What do we need in order to improve?

						* We need a safe place to practice
						* Pressure off
						* We have to learn how to play with code/design
						* It has to be fun

						### Coder Dojo Rulez

						* Timeboxed
						* Pair programming
						* Use Test-Driven Development (TDD)
						* After each session, pairs should be swapped
						* After each session, delete your code
						* Short retrospective after each session
						* Feedback session after
						* It has to be fun

						Notes:
						Timeboxed - we'll help us try more things, and we'll have more sessions.

						Pair-programming is necessary, as the knowledge transfer contained
						in that activity is essential to the practice.

						Use TDD

						After each session, pairs should be swapped—
						You should have the chance to work with new people.

						After each session, delete your code—this will release the pressure,
						the goal is not to deliver something, but concentrate on the process.
						So again, today, you don't have to deliver anything, even more, you're not
						supposed to try finishing the problem. Concentrate on the process.

						Short retrospective after each session
						We have to learn, so we need to reflect on what we just did.

						Feedback session after
						We as coder dojo organizer need to learn and improve, so we value
						your feedback.

						It has to be fun! If it's not fun, we're doing it wrong!

						### Goals

						* Learn new programming techniques
						* Pair with strangers in languages you don’t know
						* Collaborate
						* Getting away from the pressure of getting things done
						* Get out of your comfort zone

						Notes:
						Why are we doing this?

						### Rookie Mistakes

						* Trying to finish implementing the problem
						* Trying to keep your code after the session is over
						* Keeping the same pair

						Notes:
						Here are some common mistakes, you should avoid!
